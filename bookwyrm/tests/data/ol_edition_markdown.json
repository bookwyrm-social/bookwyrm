    "value": ">\"She didn't choose her garden\" opens this chapbook exploring Black womanhood, mental and physical health, spirituality, and ancestral roots. It is an investigation of how to locate a self amidst complex racial history and how to forge an authentic way forward. There's internal slippage as the subject weaves between the presence and spirits of others, as well as a reckoning with the toll of navigating this world as a Black woman. Yet, we also see hopefulness: a refuge in becoming part of the collective, beyond individuality. *The Stars With You* gives us a speculative yearning for what is to come and probes what is required to reach it.\r\n\r\n- [publisher](https://store.cooperdillon.com/product/the-stars-with-you-by-stefani-cox)"
