# Contributing
There are many ways you can contribute to this project, regardless of your level of technical expertise.

## Feedback and feature requests
Please feel encouraged and welcome to point out bugs, suggestions, feature requests, and ideas for how things ought to work using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mouse-reeve/bookwyrm/issues).

## Code contributions
Code contributions are gladly welcomed! If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the ["Good first issue"](https://github.com/mouse-reeve/bookwyrm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tag. Because BookWyrm is a small project, there isn't a lot of formal structure, but there is a huge capacity for one-on-one support, which can look like asking questions as you go, pair programming, video chats, et cetera, so please feel free to reach out.

If you have questions about the project or contributing, you can set up a video call during BookWyrm ["office hours"](https://calendly.com/mouse-reeve/30min).

## Translation
Do you speak a language besides English? BookWyrm needs localization! If you're comfortable using git and want to get into the code, there are [instructions](#working-with-translations-and-locale-files) on how to create and edit localization files. If you feel more comfortable working in a regular text editor and would prefer not to run the application, get in touch directly and we can figure out a system, like emailing a text file, that works best.

## Financial Support
BookWyrm is an ad-free passion project with no intentions of seeking out venture funding or corporate financial relationships. If you want to help keep the project going, you can donate to the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bookwyrm), or make a one time gift via [PayPal](https://paypal.me/oulipo).
